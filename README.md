# Sustain Together

## Amy Zhou, DH110 UX + UI Design, 2022 Fall

### Design Statement 
As the human population grows, sustainable communities and cities are becoming increasingly important to reduce emissions and ensure a healthier environment for ourselves and the future generations to come. Currently, information regarding sustainable communities and cities are decentralized and intimidating. When individuals learn more about the issue, they may feel like the problem is too big for individual efforts to have an impact. This project aims to make the overall goal of sustainable communities and cities  appear less intimidating by providing centralized information and  personalized action items. Users are able to sort for action items based on their budget, time, and knowledge levels. Finally, to stay motivated and encourage others, this project includes a social platform with a point based system so users can share and track their progress. The growth of this project is expected to be the result of adding and inviting friends to the platform. This project overall aims to support efforts toward United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11, Sustainable Communities and Cities. 

### Competitor Analysis 
I conducted a Heuristic Evaluation for the Institute for Sustainable Communities and United Nations Environmental Programme. Both of the sites provide information about sustainable communities and cities and potential action items that users can complete to contribute to the cause. The purpose of the Heuristic Evaluation was to analyze potential usability issues within the sites in order to avoid the same issues in my project design. The following takeaways were found for each site: 

#### Institute for Sustainable Communities at sustain.org
> Site background: The goal of ISC is to provide resources to people within the community that is being transformed; rather than act as a third party, the ISC allows local community members to take action. The ISC provides training, solutions, and resources to leaders of change. Their site contains more information about their work, as well as blogs and podcasts about sustainable communities.
> Overall evaluation: The site is information and visually pleasing with many types of media to keep the user engaged. However, there seems to be some inconsistencies in the menu bar that can make the site a bit hard to navigate. Additionally, clicking the donate button redirected me to another site without warning. These oversights can make the user experience very unpleasant. The issues mostly pertain to error prevention or resolution. The average user will probably not have an issue with this site, but it may be frustrating for users on the extreme ends (most basic and most experienced).

#### UN Environmental Programme at unep.org
> Site Background: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) sets the global environmental agenda and promotes the implementation of sustainable practices. UNEP works with many different countries, aiding in environmental agreements as well as research.

> Overall Evaluation: The UNEP has many other objectives, so it was somewhat difficult finding what I needed since I was researching only SDG 11 There is so much information on the site, that it is crowded. Navigation is tough, and the separate navigation bars make the website even more unclear. There is little support for errors, which is frustrating on a large site like this one. However, the search functions helped tremendously. Furthermore, the site does seem intuitive and visually pleasing.

  The details of the evaluation can be found [here](https://github.com/amywzhou/DH110-AMYZ/tree/main/assignment01). 

Next, I conducted a Usability Test (UT) for sustain.org in order determine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of using the site.  The tasks chosen for the the usability test were specifically catered to gain insight on the three areas of concern I found during my heuristic evaluation:
- Visibilility of System Status : The navigation bar has drop down menus that do not stay pinned; they only appear when the user hovers over the parent button. Evaluate whether or not the drop down menu affects the user's navigation of the site.
- User Control and Freedom: The "Donate" button redirects the user to a new link in a new tab. Obtain insight on how the user reacts to this new tab opening without warning.
- Error Prevention: The search feature does not have any error prevention for spelling. Identify how the lack of spellcheck impacts the average user.
The participant had an overall good impression about the site, but did express some frustrations about the heuristic violations above. The UT was very helpful during my design process as the participant’s thoughts while completing the tasks, the SUS questionnaire, and PRC provided insight on how a different user may experience issues that I didn’t personally face.

### Research

After completing competitor analysis, I conducted my own user research in order to gain insight about the context of use for my target users, working professionals between the ages of 25-35. The goal of my user research was to understand what target users found lacking or problematic with the current solutions for researching and getting involved in sustainable community efforts, so my product can address those concerns. 

During my user research, I conducted passive participant observation and a contextual inquiry. The results were very insightful and added another dimension to my original project design. The findings included:

1️⃣ Online sources are valuable and perhaps preferred for researching sustainability, but the information is not centralized.

2️⃣ Not every sustainable action is applicable to everyone, but there is at least one task that an individual can complete

3️⃣ Peer judgement has a large impact on the extent to which sustainable practices are adopted

4️⃣ Social media can be a powerful mobilizing tool

My original product only recognized decentralized information and lack of personalized tasks as issues to address. However, after user research, I learned from the participant that there is a lack of social aspect when it comes to sustainable communities and cities. After my user research, I adjusted my product to include social media feeds and a point system to motivate peers and track progress.

### UX Storytelling

To further understand user perspectives and how to address their needs, I created two personas with diverse traits to mitigate personal bias while designing. The personas aid decision-making in terms of product focus, functionality, and design trade-offs. I created two tasks based off the personas and their needs; one task is targeted toward the social platform features while the other task is targeted toward the personal enrichment and involvement features. 

* Task 1: Social Platform Feature. This task has several mini-tasks that entail having a user use the "Community" and "Profile" features of the design. The user should perform the following tasks: (1) add friend, (2) post content, (3) invite new users. Features such as the "sustainability score" will be inherently shown during this task. See Stephany's journey below.
* Task 2: Information and Action Criteria Feature. This task has several mini-tasks that entail having a user use the "Information" and "Take Action" aspects of the design. The user should perform the following tasks: (1) read about the desired social issue, (2) generate action items by user input via criteria, and (3) view the saved tasks and completed tasks on the "Profile" page. See James' journey below.

Below are the persona profiles and journey maps. 
- Persona 1: Stephany Jones, Extroverted HR Specialist and Sustainability Enthusiast in Atlanta, Georgia.
- Persona 2: James Lee, Personal Chef and Father in Portland, Oregon

### Wireframes and Low-Fidelty Prototype Wireflow 
With more insight on user perspectives and needs, I next designed a low-fidelity prototype. The low fidelity prototype serves as an early rendition of the project to see the feasibility of anticipated design. A wire flow test was conducted to provide insight on the usability of the features for the two tasks defined in UX storytelling. It was also very helpful to learn about the flow of actions that the tested followed. Based on the tester’s reactions and comments, I created changes to the original low-fidelity prototype to make the flow and features easier to understand.

UI [here](https://github.com/amywzhou/DH110-AMYZ/tree/main/assignment06)
Following the low fidelity prototype, I designed the user interface (UI) by testing several variations of shapes, colors, and fonts. The UI is an important element of the product that can keep users engaged and reduce frustrations. I made my decisions based on my goal to make the product feel friendly, but still serious. 

Spacing Considerations: 10px grid, 20px margins
> To make the app appear more professional, I aligned my elements to the 10px grid. I also utilized 20px margins to make sure the page wasn’t overcrowded. Each screen used varying numbers of rows and columns. 

Typographic Variations: Jua, Josefin Sans, and Volkhov. 
> I chose Josefin Sans because it Jua was too casual as it was very rounded and Volkhov was too serious/intimidating as it had serifs. Josefin Sans was a good in-between that was friendly and serious.

Shape Variations: Rounded (60px), Rectangle, diagonally opposite rounded corners at 45px.
> I chose rounded buttons because the rectangle option was too aggressive, and the diagonally rounded corners may not be recognized as buttons.

Color Scheme: Inspired by the original site, modified to meet accessibility requirements. 
> I used Adobe Color to extract the colors used on the original site, but modified the colors to pass the accessibility color contrast test. A darker orange is used than on the original site. 

After finalizing my user interface, I conducted two impression tests to obtain insight about the graphical design. The testers both commented on the bright red/orange of the interface. I was initially unsure how I felt about the color, but the testers liked the bright pop of color and said it particularly suited the “take action” atmosphere of the action items page. 

### High-Fidelity Prototype 
Prototype 

With the low-fidelity prototype and interface design completed, I created a high-fidelity prototype on Figma. The high-fidelity prototype is able to accomplish the two set of tasks defined in UX story telling: social platform tasks and self enrichment tasks. The high-fidelity prototype allowed me to see potential flaws in my design; being able to visualize and use the product through interactions helped me make some positive changes to the design.  Next, I  conducted a cognitive walkthrough with two peers and made changes based to the prototype based on the feedback.
