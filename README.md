### Design Statement 
As the human population grows, sustainable communities and cities are becoming increasingly important to reduce emissions and ensure a healthier environment for ourselves and the future generations to come. Addressing sustainable communities and cities may seem like too big of an issue for an individual to make an impact, so this project aims to make the overall goal appear less intimidating by providing personalized action items that each user can complete. Finally, to stay motivated and encourage others, this project includes a social platform with a point based system so users can share and track their progress.
