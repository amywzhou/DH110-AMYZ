## Introduction

The purpose of this design is to allow users to feel like they can make an impact on the huge topic of sustainable cities and communities. With global issues, it is very easy to feel like individual actions don't matter; it is not uncommon for people to think, "I'm just one person, how is it that my actions will help at all?" This project aims to mitigrate the feelings of helplessness and instead encourage people to continue or uptake their sustainable actions.

#### User Research Findings
During my user research, I found:
> 1️⃣ Online sources are valuable and perhaps perferred for researching sustainability, but the information is not centralized.
> 
> 2️⃣ Not every sustainable action is applicable to everyone, but there is at least one task that an individual can complete
> 
> 3️⃣ Peer judgement has a large impact on the extent to which sustainable practices are adopted
> 
> 4️⃣ Social media can be a powerful mobilizing tool

Based on my findings, I revised my original design. Initially, the design included only a platform that centralized information and provided customized action items for users based on input for criteria such as time, cost, and education. The new design keeps the original features, but I added a social platform aspect as well. The social aspect includes a community page where one can view their friends' activities and a sustainability point system to motivate users and their peers.

#### Personas
I developed 2 personas to understand the perspective of target users of the features. I attempted to cover a range of characteristics so I could understand the needs of multiple types of users. For example, I have one technologically advanced and educated extrovert on the younger side of the target age group and one busy, technology and sustainabliity newbie on the other older side of the target age group. It is important to serve a range of users of all technical skill and knoweldge levels. 

**Stephany Jones**, young professional, extrovert, and sustianability activist, looking for a community
> Stephany Jones is a young professional who is seeking a community of sustainable peers. She is very extroverted and requires her peers' support to keep her encouraged and strongly wishes to motivate those who aren't currently involved in the cause. She is looking for an opportunity to 1) connect with like-minded peers, 2) share her own sustainable experiences, and 3) invite and motivate peers who are not currently invovled in the cause. 

**James Lee**, busy father, personal chef, and sustainability newbie
> James Lee is a private chef and the father of a six year old son. James has very little free time, but wants to start contributing to the sustaiable communities cause becasue he is aware that his profession as a personal chef has a direct impact on the issue and he wants to make sure the world is habitable when his son is older. James is looking for a tool that will allow him to 1) find information in a centralized place, 2) find action items that are applicable to his available resources, and 3) be habitual in his sustainable efforts. 

#### Features/Purpose of Low Fidelity Prototype
This low fidelity prototype should be able to accomplish the tasks for both personas, in order to cover a range of needs and technical skills.

**Task 1: Social Platform** (Stephany's usage scenario)
> This task is a series of mini-tasks that serve the greater purpose of building a social network. 
> 1. Add or invite a friend.
> 2. Post an activity to the feed.

**Task 2: Personal Enrichment** (James' usage scenario)
> This task is a series of mini-tasks that serve the greater purpose of personal enrichment. 
> 1. Read more about a topic.
> 2. Find applicable action items based on criteria.
> 3. View saved and completed tasks.

### Documentation
Photos were taken at three stages per task for documentation purposes. Having photos was very benefical when revising the prototype as it provided records of what features needed to be changed.

### User Insights

Task 1 [Task 1 PDF](https://github.com/amywzhou/DH110-AMYZ/files/9916452/WF.task.1.pdf)

The yellow highlighter indicates the flow taken by the user when completing task 1. The user was able to complete both tasks. To add/invite a friend, the user first navigated to the "take action" page before going to the "community" page. Once at the community page, the user was easily able to add a friend but expressed confusion because they did not know what would happen after clicking "add." The user assumed that they would be navigated back to the "community" page. The user next attempted to add a post but was initially confused about where to navigate to find that feature. They eventually went to the profile page and clicked “Posts,” even though it was intended to be a title and not a button. When the user arrived at the  “add activity” wireframe, they were able to quickly complete the interactions required to publish a post. 

The pink notes are notes made by the researcher (myself) during the wireflow test.

Task 2 [Task 2 PDF](https://github.com/amywzhou/DH110-AMYZ/files/9916453/WF.Task.2.pdf)

The orange highlighter indicates the flow taken by the user when completing task 2. The user was only able to partially the task. The user was confused about where to find more details about a topic and therefore first navigated to the “take action” page, where they were able to find tasks but did not interact with the filtering features on the top bar. The user then tried again to access the information details page, and realized that they had to click the arrow on the information page. The user was frustrated that the arrow was not very obvious. From the details page, they navigated to the profile page, where they were able to easily view saved and completed tasks. However, the user complained about the lack of back/exit options as they did not recognize the symbol used by the design.

### Updated Wireframes and Wireflow
Based on the wireflow test, the prototype needed to be adjusted for ease of use. The updated features are highlighted in green and include:
- Creating a button to create a post on the community page
- Providing user feedback on whether the action was successful on the add/invite page
- Renaming the "Add activity" button to "Add post" for clarity and consistency
- Adding a "learn more" button on the information page to clarify how to access topic details
- Increasing the size of the criteria filtering features and adding instructions next to each feature
- Updating the back arrow to a more common design so users know they can return to a previous page
