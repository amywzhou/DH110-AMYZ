# DH110 Assignment02 - Pilot Usability Test 
### Amy Zhou || DH 110 Fall 2022

## Usability Testing: Purpose and Method
The purpose of this pilot Usability Test (UT) is to determine the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of using the site [sustain.org](sustain.org). During a UT, a participant is given several tasks that require them to interact with the site. The moderator can clarify questions and observe how the particpant interacts with a site to assess the ease and usability of targeted features. The information that is gathered from the UT session is intended to improve the overall usability of the site.

When completing my heuristic evaluation for sustain.org, I found some issues that needed to be addressed and wanted to obtain user insight on how to make the website better. The top three issues I focused on for sustain.org were heuristic 1, 3, and 5. A table showing the targeted heuristics is shown below.

| Number | Heuristic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Visibility of System Status | Build trust with the user through open communication and feedback.|
| 3 | User Control and Freedom | Give users the options to exit, undo, and redo. |
| 5 | Error Prevention | Eliminate or minimize errors to prevent user frustration. |

During my heuristic evaluation[^1], I found the following errors that I would like to obtain user insight on:

* _Visibilility of System Status_ : The navigation bar has drop down menus that do not stay pinned; they only appear when the user hovers over the parent button. Evaluate whether or not the drop down menu affects the user's navigation of the site.
* _User Control and Freedom_: The "Donate" button redirects the user to a new link in a new tab. Obtain insight on how the user reacts to this new tab opening without warning.
* _Error Prevention_: The search feature does not have any error prevention for spelling. Identify how the lack of spellcheck impacts the average user.

The three tasks that I created were targeted toward gaining insight on the three areas of concern I found during my heuristic evaluation, listed above. The tasks included (1) learning more about the Institute of Sustainable Communities, the host of the site; (2) finding information about their programs and utilizing the "Blogs" feature of the site; and (3) navigating the site's donation platform.  The tasks required the user to navigate the pages using the dropdown menus, open the surprise donate tab, and use the search engine--necessary user interactions needed to assess the three areas of concern I found during my heuristic evaluation.

The UT pilot took place in a generally quiet location: a closed room in a large apartment. The moderator and participant sat adjacent to each other and the UT pilot was recorded using Zoom. The screen was recorded, as well as the particpant's face. There were some unexpected external interruptions such as loud conversations in the other room and landscaping activity outdoors that may have caused some distraction, but the testing environment was secure.

## Usability Testing: Materials
The UT materials include an orientation script, an informed consent form, a pre-test questionnaire, three tasks, a post-test questionnaire, and demographic questions. The post-test questionnaire includes a system usabililty score (SUS) and a product rating card (PRC). 

The UT materials can be found [here](https://forms.gle/S871CKGJLJNPgweW8).

## Usability Testing: Pilot UT Video
The UT pilot video was recorded via Zoom on a 2017 MacBook Air. The built-in camera and microphone were used.

## Usability Testing: Reflection
Based off the input of the participant, there is room for improvement on the site sustain.org. Like I had found during my heuristic evaluation,  the participant expressed frustration with how the drop down menus would disappear and not stay pinned down. The participant was somewhat surprised that the donate button opened a new tab but did not seem displeased about it.  The last task was designed to have the participant use the search function, but the participant bypassed the search entirely and navigated the site instead so that feature could not be tested. Despite the roadblocks that the participant had during some of the tasks, they had an overall good impression about the website. 

Although I moderated the practice UT session during class, I did not find this UT pilot to be any easier than the first time. I found myself struggling to not guide the participant when I wanted them to solve a task in a specific way. For example, I was a bit frustrated when the user did not use the search function as  instructed and did not see that blog articles were sorted by category when it appeared obvious to me. The session also could have been smoother if I were a bit more clear in my descriptions; the participant had to ask a lot of clarifying questions that I did not anticipate. In the future, I will make sure the instructions and background information are more specific and clear.  I also will work on keeping my expression neutral, because when the participant was doing things as intended I found myself smiling or nodding. Despite these hiccups, I found that the overall UT pilot session was very informative and definitely served its purpose. The participant’s thoughts while completing the tasks, the SUS questionnaire, and PRC provided insight on how a different user may experience issues that I didn’t personally face and showed me how important each heuristic is when designing an website.
