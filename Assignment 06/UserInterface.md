## Impression Test
In my first impression test, the user had the following comments:
>(1) "It looked like an iPhone screen with a lot of different subsections."
>
>(2) "It had pink-orange bar on the bottom with different options."
>
>(3) "It was really bright."
>
>(4) "It had a lot of text but in different sizes."
>

I wanted more data, so I conducted another impression test, The user did not want to be recorded, but direct quotations are provided below.

>(1) "I saw lots of text and some sort of point system. I wasn't sure what the "//" notation indicated. "
>
>(2) "The dark mode is easier to read tha nthe light mode. However, the orange shaded box doesn't match the theme very well."
>
>(3) "The bottom bar was very bright and easy to read."
>
>(4) "It didn't look overly formal or professional."
>
>(5) "The colors of the app looked good."
