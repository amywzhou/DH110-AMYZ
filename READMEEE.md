## Sustainable Cities and Communities - What YOU can do!
### Amy Zhou in DH110

This project is about a future with sustainable cities and communities that can accomodate our growing populations, especially in concentrated settings. It is extremely important that communities are able to sustain themselves and support their local environment in order to help achieve the other UN goals for the year.

In my project, I hope to help the every-day citizen feel like they can make an impact on what seems like a large, daunting goal. Whether it be donating to a charity, shopping local, or living sustainably, I want everyone to feel like they can make an impact on an individual level.
