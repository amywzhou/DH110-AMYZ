# DH110 Assignment04 - Persona and Scenario
### Amy Zhou || DH 110 Fall 2022

## 📚 Purpose of UX Storytelling
- UX storytelling helps the designer understand the user perspective and how to address their needs. UX storytelling plays a vital role in filtering out personal bias that may have come into play while designing.
- Personas can be used to aid decision-making in terms of product focus, functionality, and design trade-offs.

>For my project specifically, I use two personas to examine two major services that my design would provide: a social platform and an informative resource. Since my design has several functions, I use two very different personas with different needs to analyze how each user may use the app and what needs they have. Based off individual goals, motivations, and challenges, a user may not need every feature of the app, which is why having multiple personas is important to idenitfy the desires of different types of users. 

## 🗒️ Tasks
- _Task 1: Social Platform Feature_. This task has several mini-tasks that entail having a user use the "Community" and "Profile" features of the design. The user should perform the following tasks: (1) add friend, (2) post content, (3) invite new users. Features such as the "sustainability score" will be inherently shown during this task. See Stephany's journey below.
- _Task 2: Information and Action Criteria Feature_. This task has several mini-tasks that entail having a user use the "Information" and "Take Action" aspects of the design. The user should perform the following tasks: (1) read about the desired social issue, (2) generate action items by user input via criteria, and (3) view the saved tasks and completed tasks on the "Profile" page. See James' journey below.

# 📍 Scenario + Journey

#### Stephany's Journey
Why Stephany uses the app:
>Stephany moved to Atlanta, Georgia following her graduation five years ago. When she attended Boston College as a communications major, she served as the outreach and media director for a sustainability club during her junior and senior years. Now, she enjoys her role as an HR specialist at a fashion company but many of her co-workers are not passionate about sustainability. She deeply misses her community of peers that were similarly motivated to live sustainability and wishes she could inspire her co-workers to consider sustainability. 
>
>As an HR professional, Stephany is well-versed in social media. She decides to use social media to search up profiles and groups that share the same sustainable lifestyle and actions. Stephany opens up several social media apps but is frustrated by posts unrelated to sustainable living interspersed with the content she wants to see.  She wants to share her experience with sustainability to encourage her friends, but she knows that her peers similarly have many posts unrelated to sustainability on their feeds; her post would be lost among the other posts. Stephany feels that if her friends saw how many sustainable actions she did, they would make a bigger effort to be sustainable as well. However, Stephany is frustrated by her social media platforms’ inability to make her efforts obvious amid so many other unrelated posts.

How Stephany uses the app:
>Stephany decides to contact one of her old friends from the sustainability club in college to complain about the lack of sustainable community. Her friend recommends her a new app that serves both as a social media platform and source of sustainable information. Stephany downloads the app, clicks “create account,” and sets a username and password. She is brought to an information page, which is full of posts that all related to sustainability in some way. On the bottom navigation ribbon, she sees options that say “Take Action,” “Information,””Community,” and “Profile.” Stephany is already informed and taking action, so she skips the first two options and clicks on the “Community” option and sees that she has the ability to add and invite users via phone number or email. Stephany clicks “add friend,” types in her college friend’s phone number, and navigates to the profile that pops up. She clicks “request friend” and notices a number next to her friend’s name. Stephany reads the  a button that has “learn more” in small print and a small popup informs her that the number represents that amount of sustainable tasks that her friend has completed, with each task being weighted per intensity. Stephany clicks on the “Profile” button on the navigation bar to see what she can post to obtain points. On the profile page, she clicks “Add Activity,” which prompts her to categorize her activity and upload a photo. She uploads a photo from her camera roll and selects “Community clean-up” from the dropdown list. She clicks “Post” and sees that her profile now has the number 3 next to her name, to account for the task she has completed. 
>
>Stephany is excited to share the app with her new friends and coworkers in Atlanta, GA. She returns to the community page and sees her post on the front page, as well as her college friend’s posts under hers since her friend had added her back. She clicks “add friend” and inputs the emails of her new community, and clicks “invite.” The system notifies her with a popup that an invitation email has been sent to her invitees. Stephany is happy that she is able to connect with her peers on an app focused on sustainability and encourage her new community with her posts and score.

#### James' Journey
Why James uses the app:
>James is private personal chef living in San Francisco with his wife and six year old son. He has a busy schedule with driving his son to extracurriculars and high work demand. As a private chef, James is aware that there is a connection between food consumption, resource usage, and sustainability and feels a moral obligation to learn more—especially since he is concerned about how the world will function when his son is older. However, between work and taking care of his son, James feels like he doesn’t have the time or the attention span to do research to learn more about sustainable communities and doesn’t know what else he can do to contribute to the effort. 
>
>While waiting for his son’s soccer practice to conclude, James pulls out his phone to do some quick research on sustainability. He already has several tabs open, but he keeps opening new tabs to look up information in the current article. He is getting overwhelmed  because he feels like the information is spread out across several websites and he cannot find action items that are applicable to himself on any one source. He wishes there was a single source that would summarize sustainable issues for beginners and provide action items specific for busy people like himself.

How James uses the app:
>James shares his frustration with one of the other parents waiting to pick up their child. The other parent recommends her a new app that serves that is a social media platform, but has features that allow users to learn more about sustainability in simple posts and has the ability to filter action items based on criteria. James downloads the app, clicks “create account,” and sets a username and password. He is brought to an information page that summarizes different sustainable initiatives. On the bottom navigation ribbon, he  sees options that say “Take Action,” “Information,””Community,” and “Profile.”  James decides to stay on the information page because he wants to learn more about a specific topic. He clicks on “Sustainable cities and communities” and is brought to a page that summarizes the issue and its impact. James reads the information and finds it easy to understand what the underlying issue is. James next clicks on “Take Action” to look for the criteria feature the other parent had mentioned. He sees a list of actions  and  options on the top of the page  to set criteria for cost, time, and knowledge. He clicks the ‘low’ time option and ‘beginner’ knowledge option and watches as new options filter to the front of the page. He finds the options on the page very doable and clicks “save” on the actions that he wants to incorporate in his life. James skips over the “Community” tab because as an introverted person, he isn’t looking to share his actions with anyone. James then clicks “profile” and sees buttons that says “saved tasks” and “completed tasks”. Having already completed one earlier in the week, James marks the task as “completed” and sees that the task is moved from the “saved” section to the “completed” section. He also sees his “sustainability score” increase, but feels that the metric is unnecessary for him and would rather rely on the completion log.
>
>James is happy that information about sustainable topics is centralized on the app, with summaries and basic information that he, as a sustainability beginner, can understand without having to cross-reference several other sources. He feels relieved that the app is able to find action items for him based on the resources he has that week, whether it be time, money, or knowledge. He finds the action log very helpful in keeping him accountable and making him feel proud of his contributions at the end of the week. Learning about sustainability and actively completing tasks allow James to feel like he is doing his part to make sure the Earth is habitable for his son in the future.
