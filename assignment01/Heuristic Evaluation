| **1\. Visibility of system status**                              | **Good**: The navigation bar travels with the page as the user scrolls. The tab that the user is hovering over is highlighted to convey where the cursor is. <br>**Bad**: When on a subpage, the navigation bar on top does not stay highlighted so the user may not know what tab they clicked into.     | When the user is on a subpage, keep the navigation bar highlighted so it is clear what page has been clicked into.                       | 2                         |

| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**                          | **Good**: Site has descriptions for visuals used. <br>**Bad**: Titles that are written on top of visuals can be difficult to read if there is a lack of contrast between text and visual.                                                                                                                 | Provide a highlight behind title text that is displayed over images.                                                                     | 3                         |

Help and documentation**                                  | **Good**: The site has a "Contact Us" button that allows user input to offices. <br>**Bad**: The location of the Contact page is hidden and there is no FAQ page.                                                                                                                                         | Make the Contact page a hyperlink on the footer or put it in a more obvious location. Add a FAQ page.                                    | 3                         |

_Overall Evaluation_: While the site is informative and aesthetically pleasing, there are some oversights that can make the user experience very unpleasant. What stood out to me was be redirected to another site without warning upon clicking the donate button. The other issues mostly pertain to error preventation or resolution. The average user will probably not have an issue with this site, but it may be frustrating for users on the extreme ends (most basic and most experienced.
