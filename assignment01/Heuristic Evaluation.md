# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation 
## Tentative Project Name: sUstainability- what U can do!

In this project, I hope to create a site that allows users to know how they, on an individual level, can contribute to building sustainable cities and communities. When the goal sounds so broad and daunting, it is easy for the individual to feel that they have nothing to contribute to the goal. I hope to create a friendly site that allows the every-day citizen to feel like they can make an impact. Whether it be donating to a charity or shopping locally, there is something for everyone.

## **Critique 1: Institute for Sustainable Communities at [sustain.org](sustain.org)**

</p>

_Site Background_: Sustain.org is the website for the Institute for Sustainable Communities (ISC). The goal of ISC is to provide resources to people within the community that is being transformed; rather than act as a third party, the ISC allows local community members to take action. The ISC provides training, soluations, and resources to leaders of change. Their site contains more information about their work, as well as blogs and podcasts about sustainable communities.  

_Overall Evaluation_: The site is information and visually pleasing with many types of media to keep the user engaged. However, there seems to be some inconsistencies in the menu bar that can make the site a bit hard to navigate. Additionally, when I clicked donate, it redirected me to another site without warning, which made me want to not return back to the original site.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------| ------------------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**                              | **Good**: The navigation bar travels with the page as the user scrolls. The tab that the user is hovering over is highlighted to convey where the cursor is. <br>**Bad**: When on a subpage, the navigation bar on top does not stay highlighted so the user may not know what tab they clicked into.     | When the user is on a subpage, keep the navigation bar highlighted so it is clear what page has been clicked into.                       | 2                         |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**                  | **Good**: The site uses common vocabulary that is not niche to a specific field. <br>**Bad**: The search function may be made a bit clearer since only a magnifying glass is depicted.                                                                                                                    | Add the word "Search" on the search icon to clarify its purpose.                                                                         | 1                         |
| **3\. User control and freedom**                                 | **Good**: No forced autoplay of media. <br>**Bad**: The donate tab redirects to a different site and opens a new tab without warning. There are no exit, undo, or redo buttons. Once navigated from home, the only way back is clicking the logo.                                                                                  | Provide pop-up warning window if the user is going to be redirected to a new site through a new tab.                                     | 3                         |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**                                | **Good**: Consistent font with pinned navigation bar. <br>**Bad**: The dropdown menu layout differs in the first tab, "programs," than the rest of the tabs.                                                                                                                                                  | Make drop down menu layout standard so users are more familiar with the interface.                                                       | 2                         |
| **5\. Error prevention**                                         | **Good**: The search results let you know if nothing was found rather than breaking down. <br>**Bad**: No suggested search options for misspelled inputs. No warning of leaving the search page with new data input.                                                                                      | Provide suggested searches for misspelled words and inform users if a search was not conducted.                                          | 2                         |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**                           | **Good**: The navigation bar is quite standard so users do not have to learn how to navigate the site. <br>**Bad**: The page layouts all differ due to the varying types of media beign portrayed.                                                                                                        | Try to find a page layout that works for all types of media.                                                                             | 2                         |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**                        | **Good**: There are blog categories on the side so users can sort through blog entries easily. <br>**Bad**: Lacking advanced search options for experienced users.                                                                                                                                        | Give experienced users the opportunty to run advanced searches such as exact or keywords.                                                | 1                         |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**                          | **Good**: Site has descriptions for visuals used. <br>**Bad**: Titles that are written on top of visuals can be difficult to read if there is a lack of contrast between text and visual.                                                                                                                 | Provide a highlight behind title text that is displayed over images.                                                                     | 3                         |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**  | **Good**: Email subscriptions check for email format in user input and notify the user if it is wrong. <br>**Bad**: No description of error when a subpage url is misspelled.                                                                                                                                                                | Generate a 404 Page Not Found Error page in the case of an old or misspelled url.                                                        | 3                         |
| **10\. Help and documentation**                                  | **Good**: The site has a "Contact Us" button that allows user input to be sent to offices. <br>**Bad**: The location of the Contact page is hidden and there is no FAQ page.                                                                                                                                         | Make the Contact page a hyperlink on the footer or put it in a more obvious location. Add a FAQ page.                                    | 3                         |

_Post Evaluation_: There are some oversights that can make the user experience very unpleasant. The issues mostly pertain to error preventation or resolution. The average user will probably not have an issue with this site, but it may be frustrating for users on the extreme ends (most basic and most experienced).

## **Critique 2: UN Environmental Programme at [unep.org](unep.org)**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./unep.png" alt="Sustain Homepage" width = "500px"/> <img src="./unep3.png" alt="Sustain Homepage" width = "500px"/>
</p>

_Site Background_: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) sets the global environmental agenda and promotes the implmentation of sustainable practices. UNEP works with many different countries, aiding in environmental agreements as well as research. 

_Overall Evaluation_: I chose this site because the Sustainable Development Goals are formulated by the UN, so they themselves must have plenty of resources to help achieve the goals. However, since the UNEP has many other objectives, it was somewhat difficult finding what I needed since I was researching only SDG 11. However, the serach functions helped tremendously; when I saw the routing path of the article of which I was interested, I knew the site would be crowded with information that can make reserach difficult.  On first glance, the site does seem intuitive and visually pleasing.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------| ------------------------- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**                              | **Good**: The dropdown bar stays fixed when ethe user clicks on the parent tab, making it easier for the user to navigate where they want to go. <br>**Bad**: There seems to be two navigation bars, which is confusing. Additionally, the navigation bars do not travel with the screen.                 | Have a single navigation bar so the user has a better understanding of where they are.                                                   | 3                         |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**                  | **Good**: the audience of the UNEP is worldwide, but there are different language options available.  <br>**Bad**: The button to change the language is only displayed in one language, but users probably need it in multiple languages in order to find the button.                                     | Display the language button in multiple languages so it is accessible to a worldwide audience.                                           | 2                         |

There are no exit, undo, or redo buttons. Once navigated from home, the only way back is clicking the logo.                                               | Provide pop-up warning window if the user is going to be redirected to a new site through a new tab.                                     | 3                         |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**                                | **Good**: Consistent font and media size. <br>**Bad**: The first two navigation tabs have the same drop down menu, but not the third tab.                                                                                                                                                                 | Make drop down menu layout standard so users are more familiar with the interface.                                                       | 2                         |

No warning of leaving the search page with new data input.                                                                                                            | Provide suggested searches for misspelled words and inform users if a search was not conducted.                                          | 2                         |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**                           | **Good**: Information is sorted intuitively into navigation bar. <br>**Bad**:There are too many options in the drop down bar; the user has to sort through several subpages to find what they are looking for.                                                                                            | Consider making information less nested so users do not have to click through five pages to find what they need.                         | 3                         |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**                        | **Good**: N/A; Not very easy to use for all user levels.  <br>**Bad**: No visible shortcuts or advanced options for more experienced users. Too many internal redirects for basic users.                                                                                                                  | Cater to all levels of users by giving more options to experienced users and having a simple original website for the basic users.       | 2                         |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**                          | **Good**: Generally, no overcrowding of information on one page. <br>**Bad**: Information is sorted into three different locations: two navigation bars and an extensive footer.                                                                                                                          | Centralize information so users can find it more easily.                                                                                 | 3                         |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**  | **Good**: 404 Page not found error shows up for nonexistant urls. <br>**Bad**: Search function is finnicky, but there is no popup to explain why it works sometimes and other times not.                                                                                                                  | Provide feedback on why some features may not be functional.                                                                             | 3                         |
| **10\. Help and documentation**                                  | **Good**: The site has a "Contact Us" form that allows users to request help. <br>**Bad**: There is no FAQ page.                                                                                                                                                                                          | Add a FAQ page so users do not have to wait for a response.                                                                              | 3                         |

_Post Evaluation_: There is so much information on the site, that it is crowded. Navigation is tough, and the separate navigation bars make the website even more unclear. There is little support for errors, which is frustrating on a large site like this one.
