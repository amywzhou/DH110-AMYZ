## Sustainable Cities and Communities
### Amy Zhou in DH110

This project is about a future with sustainable cities and communities that can accomodate our growing populations, especially in concentrated settings. It is extremely important that communities are able to sustain themselves and support their local environment in order to help achieve the other UN goals for the year.
