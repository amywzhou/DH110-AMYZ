## Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
> My project aims to help individuals find how they contribute to the sustainable development goal of sustainable cities and communities. With a goal this large, it is sometimes difficult for an individual to feel like their actions have an impact. The main activity of my project is to provide users with a list of actions--based on their inputs/filters for time, financial input, and other factors--that would provide a tangible result. Users should feel like the information is accessible and trustworthy. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
> This activity fulfills the user’s basic need of esteem because it would help them feel like they are making a difference in a larger problem, therefore elevating their own self-respect. It may also satisfy the “lower version” of esteem where the user can gain the respect of others for doing their part in a societal problem; this site may help them attain recognition and status for their efforts in support sustainable communities. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> The current solution to satisfy the esteem for supporting sustainable communities is searching the web to find information scattered across multiple sites. Users must sort through lists of suggestions in order to find an option that is possible for them to implement, whether it be finding an opportunity to volunteer, an organization to donate to, or simply shopping local. Another solution would be to rely on word of mouth; people may choose to take action based on the suggestions of their peers. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> Users currently have to search several web pages to find information relevant to their own situation. Centralize information on how individuals can contribute based on their means. The user should be able to sort actions by cost, time, and other factors to show that they can make an impact within their personal resources.Word of mouth is not a very prolific method of raising awareness about sustainable cities and communities, so having a digital database of activites can make the information more accessible. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
> The users are working professionals of any ethnicity between the age of 25-35. The location of the users should be within the United States for this project, with potential to expand to an international audience upon success. User expertise level can vary from basic to expert but there is a preference for individuals with internet and basic internet searching abilities. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>	Users would research ways they can contribute to a bigger problem when they feel they have extra resources to spend. This can be time, energy, expertise, or money. The activity may see a spike in action following the publication of environmental reports/goals or after an environmental crisis. The activity of searching for sustainable practices to support their communities can be done anywhere, although it is likely to be done at a user’s home when they have spare time. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
> Users would usually use a search engine to look up how they can contribute. They might have to navigate several websites in order to find an action item they can do that is relevant to themselves. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
 
I used a mix of observation methods.

**Passive Participant Observation**
> Before asking for the user's participation in the contextual inquiry, I shadowed the user and took field notes without identifying myself as a researcher. I observed her activities as she browsed the internet on a weekday evening. The field notes can be found below. 
 
 **Active Participant Observation**
> During the contextual inquiry, I conducted an interview, which is a form of active participant observation. During the interview, I learned about the participant's activities, habits, interests, and goals. 

**Overt-Passive Partcipant Observation** 
> During the activities section of the contextual inquiry, I made myself known as a researcher but did not play a part in the activities. (Or tried not to)

### Here are some interesting quotes and insights from the interview:

**:one: Online sources are valuable and perhaps perferred for researching sustainability, but the information is not centralized.**
> (11:32) I don't know any specific organizations. I do feel like there's so many. But I think that's also the problem. There's just so many without one being the most popular.

> (56:07) Definitely the web, social media,just online, I guess [...]  I guess you can like read a book about it, too. But I think the easiest way to learn is to go into the search engine and just ask questions that you're interested in. It's really the fastest and most accessible way to get information about sustainability.

**:two: Not every sustainable action is applicable to everyone, but there is at least one task that an individual can complete**
> (22:33) "Anyone, everyone would be able to pick something from here to work towards the goal."

> (51:55) "..there may be some things that others don't have the capacity for. But I think there will always be at least one thing that someone could do to contribute..."

**:three: Peer judgement has a large impact on the extent to which sustainable practices are adopted**
> (53:46) "...that encourages me, and to see other people also like switching over to reusable straws. I think that also encourages me to see other people doing it, knowing that, like I'm not the only one doing it. And I think that leads me to what discourages me. If I'm like taking all these steps to minimize ways that to use reusable items, and no one else is doing it. Sometimes I feel discouraged, because you know, I'm the only one, it feels like. I'm the only one like, What am I? How is my lifestyle going to make an impact if I'm the only one out of all my friends who are doing this?"

**:four: Social media can be a powerful mobilizing tool**
> (24:40) "Probably if I was on Instagram and someone started talking about [an environmental issue] , and i'd be likely I'm gonna learn more about that. 

> (57:57) "Everything now is social media. So if there's a way to somehow incorporate like such actions into social media. So you can see, like what your friends are up to. Maybe we like your friend at a beach clean up like if There's an app to see how, ah, how we were contributing to minimizing, waste, or working towards sustainability, and others would feel more inspired..."


## Reflection

I found the participant observation and contextual inquiry to be very insightful. In fact, I feel that the direction of my project has changed based on the information I learned from the participant. My project’s goal was to make sure individuals can feel like they have an impact in a large problem by providing action tasks that are catered to their available resources; for example, one may filter by how intensive an action is based on time, money, and knowledge. Currently, a user would have to browse several sites in order to find something that they actually contribute with. My project aims to centralize the information and raise the esteem of the users as they realize that there is something that they can do to help the larger issue at hand: sustainable cities and communities. Based off this contextual inquiry, the participant believes that there _is_ something that everyone can do; the participant did not really believe the design challenge I was addressing was an issue at all, except for acknowledging that information is not centralized. Instead, they believe the missing solution in addressing sustainability is the interaction with peers, which would encourage sustainable actions. Thus, my project moving forward will still provide centralized information and allow users to filter by their available resources, but there will be a larger emphasis on the social aspect. My project will encompass a social platform where users can share what action they have done to support sustainable cities and communities, so their peers will be more encouraged to do the same. Then, the users can use the information/task finder to find out how they can also contribute to the sustainable cities and communities so they too can share their impact with their peers. 

Although I found the contextual inquiry and participant observation helpful, there are some items that could be improved on in the future. During the contextual inquiry, I was very focused on making the participant feel at ease and facilitating the interview as a discussion, so I may have induced some bias with my responses, such as “I completely agree with you.” At the same time, I would make a bigger effort to make the participant understand that I wanted to observe their natural actions as it was clear that she was hyperaware of the recording, having asked me several times if the screen was still being shared. The activities I provided definitely served its purpose, but I would make them broader next time. Although I did not specifically ask about my focus, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and let the participant choose any sustainable goal of their choice, it was clear that the activities were not something that the participant did normally so they struggled with the tasks. Creating broader tasks would help fix this, such as removing the sustainability constraint on the activities. For example, it may have been better to simply the participant to find an organization they would be interested in volunteering with or donating to, rather than limiting them to an environmental organization. Since the participant was unfamiliar with the tasks, they had to ask a lot of clarifying questions and my answers were not entirely bias free (something I need to work on).
