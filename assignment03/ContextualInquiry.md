## Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the main design challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
> My project aims to help individuals find how they contribute to the sustainable development goal of sustainable cities and communities. With a goal this large, it is sometimes difficult for an individual to feel like their actions have an impact. The main activity of my project is to provide users with a list of actions--based on their inputs/filters for time, financial input, and other factors--that would provide a tangible result. Users should feel like the information is accessible and trustworthy. 

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
> This activity fulfills the user’s basic need of esteem because it would help them feel like they are making a difference in a larger problem, therefore elevating their own self-respect. It may also satisfy the “lower version” of esteem where the user can gain the respect of others for doing their part in a societal problem; this site may help them attain recognition and status for their efforts in support sustainable communities. 

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
> The current solution to satisfy the esteem for supporting sustainable communities is searching the web to find information scattered across multiple sites. Users must sort through lists of suggestions in order to find an option that is possible for them to implement, whether it be finding an opportunity to volunteer, an organization to donate to, or simply shopping local. Another solution would be to rely on word of mouth; people may choose to take action based on the suggestions of their peers. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
> Users currently have to search several web pages to find information relevant to their own situation. Centralize information on how individuals can contribute based on their means. The user should be able to sort actions by cost, time, and other factors to show that they can make an impact within their personal resources.Word of mouth is not a very prolific method of raising awareness about sustainable cities and communities, so having a digital database of activites can make the information more accessible. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 2: Identify target users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
> The users are working professionals of any ethnicity between the age of 25-35. The location of the users should be within the United States for this project, with potential to expand to an international audience upon success. User expertise level can vary from basic to expert but there is a preference for individuals with internet and basic internet searching abilities. 

**In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity?**
>	Users would research ways they can contribute to a bigger problem when they feel they have extra resources to spend. This can be time, energy, expertise, or money. The activity may see a spike in action following the publication of environmental reports/goals or after an environmental crisis. The activity of searching for sustainable practices to support their communities can be done anywhere, although it is likely to be done at a user’s home when they have spare time. 

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
> Users would usually use a search engine to look up how they can contribute. They might have to navigate several websites in order to find an action item they can do that is relevant to themselves. 

### :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick observation method(s)
 
I used a mix of observation methods.

**Passive Participant Observation**
> Before asking for the user's participation in the contextual inquiry, I shadowed the user and took field notes without identifying myself as a researcher. I observed her activities as she browsed the internet on a weekday evening. The field notes can be found below. 
 
 **Active Participant Observation**
> During the contextual inquiry, I conducted an interview, which is a form of active participant observation. During the interview, I learned about the participant's activities, habits, interests, and goals. 

**Overt-Passive Partcipant Observation** 
> During the activities section of the contextual inquiry, I made myself known as a researcher but did not play a part in the activities. (Or tried not to)

### Here are some interesting quotes and insights from the interview:

**:one: Not every sustainable action is applicable to everyone, but there is at least one task that an individual can complete**
> (22:33) "Anyone, everyone would be able to pick something from here to work towards the goal."

> (51:55) "..there may be some things that others don't have the capacity for. But I think there will always be at least one thing that someone could do to contribute..."

**:two:**
> .

**:three: Peer judgement has a large impact on the extent to which sustainable practices are adopted**
> (53:46) "...that encourages me, and to see other people also like switching over to reusable straws. I think that also encourages me to see other people doing it, knowing that, like I'm not the only one doing it. And I think that leads me to what discourages me. If I'm like taking all these steps to minimize ways that to use reusable items, and no one else is doing it. Sometimes I feel discouraged, because you know, I'm the only one, it feels like. I'm the only one like, What am I? How is my lifestyle going to make an impact if I'm the only one out of all my friends who are doing this?"

**:four: Social media can be a powerful mobilizing tool**
> (24:40) "Probably if I was on Instagram and someone started talking about [an environmental issue] , and i'd be likely I'm gonna learn more about that. 

> (57:57) "Everything now is social media. So if there's a way to somehow incorporate like such actions into social media. So you can see, like what your friends are up to. Maybe we like your friend at a beach clean up like if There's an app to see how, ah, how we were contributing to minimizing, waste, or working towards sustainability, and others would feel more inspired..."
