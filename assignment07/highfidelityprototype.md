## Introduction

### Project Description
This project aims to help the average citizen feel like they can contribute to the bigger cause of sustainable communities and cities. The project will serve both inexperienced and advanced users by promoting information, suggesting tasks, and creating a sense of community. Specifically, this project will (1) centralize information from various sources, (2) allow users to find action items that are applicable to their unique available resources, (3) provide a platform where users can share their experiences to motivate their peers, whom they can add and invite on the platform. 

This interactive prototype was made visualize the elements as they would appear on an iPhone 8 and to check the flow of interactions the user may have while completing tasks related to the purpose of the project. For this prototype, the tasks fall under two categories to address two sets of needs: social needs and self enrichment needs. Thus, the tasks are split into the following:

Social Tasks
> Add or invite a friend to the app.
> 
> View another person's profile.
> 
> Create a post.

Self Enrichment Tasks
> Find more information about a sustainable topic.
> 
> Find and save action items that are applicable to the user.
> 
> Review saved and finished items to track progress. 

This prototype was developed using Figma with the Stark, Material Icons, and AutoFlow plugins. Additionally, a [Figma community resource](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1059520912220032057) was used to incorporate a dropdown menu into the "Action Items" Page.

## Cognitive Walkthrough

Two reviewers completed a cognitive walkthrough to provide insight on the flow of interactions for the given tasks. The cognitive walkthrough was prefaced by a quick impression test. During the impression test, the reviewers found the color scheme enjoyable and thought that the purpose of the app was obvious after logging in. During the cognitve walkthrough,the users were able to complete the tasks with very minimal confusion. The exact comments are shown below. 

 Impression Test 
 
|   | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 |
|---|---|---|
|**What do you see?**| I see a log in and create account button as well as a logo | logo and login / create account options|
|**What do you think that web/app is about?**|I'm not very sure, my first assumption is that it's a social platform. | unsure| 
|**What do you think you can do with this web/app?**| Interact with others and make posts | make an account but unsure what for|
|**Any other comments?**| I like the color scheme | after logging in its obvious that its for finding community and learning more |

Cognitive Walkthrough
 
|   | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 |
|---|---|---|
|**Is there any point that the users may not understand what this screen(feedback) is about?**|Since the bottom navigation bar is the main point of reference and the landing page is the information page, I think it would be good to turn it into a home icon instead of a book. The points are not really intuitive to what they do or bring to the user from the initial interaction.|no back button (to landing page), may be confusing|
|**Is there any point that the users may not recognize where to click or select?**|No, the signifiers and feedback are great on this interface|n/a|
|**Is there any point that the users may feel lost and may not sure whether the progress is being made toward what they want to achieve?**|I don't think so, because the feedback on certain actions is pretty clear|when the dropdown menu isnt responsive|
|**Is there any point that the users would not know what to do the next step?**|For these specific tasks, no. they are straightforward|n/a|
|**Is there any point that is not clear where to return or missing back-flow of cancel or exit?**|No, there are clear cancel/exit buttons|no back button (to landing page) which is confusing|
|**Is there anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing?**|The points system is not very intuitive as mentioned before|n/a|
|**Any other comments?**|I think adding a friends list somewhere on the profile would be nice. This could be visible to only the user.| make images into buttons so the site is more clickable. When an action is successful leading user to new page might be helpful.|

## Reflection and Changes 
The cognitive walkthrough went relatively well. Both reviewers were able to complete the given tasks with just a few hiccups. I didn't anticpate the issues that they had, so I was glad that the cognitive walkthrough could show me the perspective of potential users. For example, both reviewers struggled to identify that the information mation page was the landing page, despite having that tab of the navigation bar highlighted upon login.The reviewers were looking for a back button to get back to the landing page, which I didn't expect. To clarify the situation, I changed the logo fo the information page to be the home symbol. Another thing that I noticed during the cognitive walkthrough was that sometimes reviewers left comments about missing features that already existed. One reviewer suggested displaying points on the profile page, which was already a feature. I realized that to really grab the users’ attention, things must stand out, so I  added an information icon and overlay by the points to draw more attention and even provide further information. I received other helpful comments as well about the functionality of the design. I added additional interactions such as clicking images to lead to another page and troubleshooted the drop down menu since it worked for one reviewer but didn’t work for another reviewer (still unsure why).  Overall, the cognitive walkthroughs were very helpful in understanding the thought process of potential users and identify issues with the prototype. A detailed log of changes is shown below. 

| Problem | Change |
|---|---|
|Users may get confused on how to navigate back to the landing page since it is not very obvious that the landing page is the information page; lack of clear option to navigate back to landing page. | Change the book logo for information to the widely-recognized home logo so it is clear that the information page is the landing page.|
|Dropdown responsiveness is varied. When the dropdown doesn't work, the user is unsure if progress is being made.|Troubleshoot the dropdown menu so it works as intended.|
|Point system purpose is unclear.|Add a small info logo that, when clicked, has a pop-up explaining the point system.|
|Clicking images should route somewhere on the information/landing page.|Add intereaction where clicking a photo will route to the respective topic detail page.|
