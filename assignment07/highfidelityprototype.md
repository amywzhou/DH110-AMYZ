## Introduction

### Project Description
This project aims to help the average citizen feel like they can contribute to the bigger cause of sustainable communities and cities. The project will serve both inexperienced and advanced users by promoting information, suggesting tasks, and creating a sense of community. Specifically, this project will (1) centralize information from various sources, (2) allow users to find action items that are applicable to their unique available resources, (3) provide a platform where users can share their experiences to motivate their peers, whom they can add and invite on the platform. 

This interactive prototype was made visualize the elements as they would appear on an iPhone 8 and to check the flow of interactions the user may have while completing tasks related to the purpose of the project. For this prototype, the tasks fall under two categories to address two sets of needs: social needs and self enrichment needs. Thus, the tasks are split into the following:

Social Tasks
> Add or invite a friend to the app.
> 
> View another person's profile.
> 
> Create a post.

Self Enrichment Tasks
> Find more information about a sustainable topic.
> 
> Find and save action items that are applicable to the user.
> 
> Review saved and finished items to track progress. 

This prototype was developed using Figma with the Stark, Material Icons, and AutoFlow plugins. Additionally, a [Figma community resource](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1059520912220032057) was used to incorporate a dropdown menu into the "Action Items" Page.

## Impression Test and Cognitive Walkthrough
 
 Impression Test 
 
|   | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 |
|---|---|---|
|**What do you see?**| I see a log in and create account button as well as a logo | logo and login / create account options|
|**What do you think that web/app is about?**|I'm not very sure, my first assumption is that it's a social platform. | unsure| 
|**What do you think you can do with this web/app?**| Interact with others and make posts | make an account but unsure what for|
|**Any other comments?**| I like the color scheme | after logging in its obvious that its for finding community and learning more |

Cognitive Walkthrough
 
|   | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 |
|---|---|---|
|**Is there any point that the users may not understand what this screen(feedback) is about?**|Since the bottom navigation bar is the main point of reference and the landing page is the information page, I think it would be good to turn it into a home icon instead of a book. The points are not really intuitive to what they do or bring to the user from the initial interaction.|no back button (to landing page), may be confusing|
|**Is there any point that the users may not recognize where to click or select?**|No, the signifiers and feedback are great on this interface|n/a|
|**Is there any point that the users may feel lost and may not sure whether the progress is being made toward what they want to achieve?**|I don't think so, because the feedback on certain actions is pretty clear|when the dropdown menu isnt responsive|
|**Is there any point that the users would not know what to do the next step?**|For these specific tasks, no. they are straightforward|n/a|
|**Is there any point that is not clear where to return or missing back-flow of cancel or exit?**|No, there are clear cancel/exit buttons|no back button (to landing page) which is confusing|
|**Is there anything inconsistent, missing, or confusing?**|The points system is not very intuitive as mentioned before|n/a|
|**Any other comments?**|I think adding a friends list somewhere on the profile would be nice. This could be visible to only the user.| make images into buttons so the site is more clickable. When an action is successful leading user to new page might be helpful.|

## Reflection and Changes 
The cognitive walkthrough will be conducted in class on Nov. 16, 2022. The reflection and changes will be updated shortly after.
