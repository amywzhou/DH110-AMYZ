## Introduction

### Project Description
This project aims to help the average citizen feel like they can contribute to the bigger cause of sustainable communities and cities. The project will serve both inexperienced and advanced users by promoting information, suggesting tasks, and creating a sense of community. Specifically, this project will (1) centralize information from various sources, (2) allow users to find action items that are applicable to their unique available resources, (3) provide a platform where users can share their experiences to motivate their peers, whom they can add and invite on the platform. 

This interactive prototype was made visualize the elements as they would appear on an iPhone 8 and to check the flow of interactions the user may have while completing tasks related to the purpose of the project. For this prototype, the tasks fall under two categories to address two sets of needs: social needs and self enrichment needs. Thus, the tasks are split into the following:

Social Tasks
> Add or invite a friend to the app.
> 
> View another person's profile.
> 
> Create a post.

Self Enrichment Tasks
> Find more information about a sustainable topic.
> 
> Find and save action items that are applicable to the user.
> 
> Review saved and finished items to track progress. 

This prototype was developed using Figma with the Stark, Material Icons, and AutoFlow plugins. Additionally, a [Figma community resource](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1059520912220032057) was used to incorporate a dropdown menu into the "Action Items" Page.
